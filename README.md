RC Car and Part Designs and Models

# Project Conventions
All files are named with a version starting at `*-v1` to help track edits. This is different than git versions as
those are for fixes etc., and users may have different reasons to use different versions if a part so each of thsoe
version are current whereas git versions and commits are for historical reference and fixes to designs and models.
