RC Car and Part Designs and Models

# Project Conventions

When adding new parts:
1. Create a new directory for the part using lowercase-with-hyphens naming
2. Include a part-specific `README` with version history and print settings
3. Upload both design files (`.f3d`, `.step`) and export files (`.stl`)
4. Start with `v1` and increment versions for significant changes

# Printing Guidelines

- **Material**: PETG recommended for structural parts, PLA acceptable for non-stressed components
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm for most parts, 0.1mm for precise fitment
- **Infill**: 30-50% depending on part stress requirements
- **Supports**: Required for most parts - see individual part READMEs
